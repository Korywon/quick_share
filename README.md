## How To Use

Quick Share will automatically recalculate any inputs or changes you make to
the text fields. Enter in the amount of cash you wish to use to buy, then set
a range to calculate from and to with the limits. The step defines every
iteration the web app goes through during calculation. The sig. figs. field
will determine the number of decimal places to use (handy for fractional
shares or increase precision).
